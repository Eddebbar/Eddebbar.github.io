I am a postdoctoral scholar interested in ocean biogeochemical and physical dynamics and climate. I work at the [Center for Climate CHange Impacts and Adaptation](https://climateadapt.ucsd.edu) on understanding climate change on marine ecosystems. Some of my interests include:

Ocean Carbon Cycle
======
The ocean carbon cycle is tightly intertwined with climate and ocean circulation. Some of the key questions I am interested in are:
1. What explains the interannual to decadal variability of air-sea carbon cycling? 
1. How will ocean carbon uptake change in the future?  
1. What controls the ocean carbon uptake efficiency?
